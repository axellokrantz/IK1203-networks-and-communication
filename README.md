# IK1203 Networks and Communication
## Course contents
* Flow control and error control: flow control (stop&wait, sliding window), error detection and error handling, error correcting codes, retransmission (ARQ).
* Layered models: overview of OSI and TCP/IP.
* LAN (Local Area Network) and LAN-systems: topologies, access- techniques and protocols, token ring, Ethernet, wireless networks bridged networks, spanning tree computation and VLAN.
* Packet and circuit switching: WAN (Wide Area Network) and public networks, principles, characteristics and protocols.
* Internetworking and IP: design principles and building blocks, connection oriented vs. connectionless protocols, Internet routing and Internet Protocol (IP).
* Transport layer protocols: TCP, UDP.
* Communcation models: "Client-server" and "peer-to-peer".
* Applications: DNS, SMTP, FTP, HTTP, Telnet mm.
* Network programming.

## Intended learning outcomes

After passing the course, students should be able to:

* Describe and explain the basic terminology used in networking and communication.
* Analyse communication scenarios and application requirements, and explain what methods and algorithms are suitable to use for a desired communication service.
* Explain, model and analyse the behaviour of networks using different methods for error control, flow control and congestion control, and predict how such a system will 
react in response to different events and conditions.
* Explain the functions of protocols of the different layers of the Internet model, and how different layers interact with each other.
* Explain and implement basic algorithms and mechanisms for error detection, error correction, flow control, congestion control and routing.
* Design, implement and analyse the behaviour of basic Internet applications and their protocols.
* Explain different functions and concepts concerning equipment for communication and networks.
* Compute and/or approximate the performance of communication systems, and suggest improvements.
