# IK1203 Networks and Communication
## Course contents
* Flow control and error control: flow control (stop&wait, sliding window), error detection and error handling, error correcting codes, retransmission (ARQ).
* Layered models: overview of OSI and TCP/IP.
* LAN (Local Area Network) and LAN-systems: topologies, access- techniques and protocols, token ring, Ethernet, wireless networks bridged networks, spanning tree computation and VLAN.
* Packet and circuit switching: WAN (Wide Area Network) and public networks, principles, characteristics and protocols.
* Internetworking and IP: design principles and building blocks, connection oriented vs. connectionless protocols, Internet routing and Internet Protocol (IP).
* Transport layer protocols: TCP, UDP.

* Applications: DNS, SMTP, FTP, HTTP, Telnet mm.
* Network programming.

## Intended learning outcomes

After passing the course, students should be able to:

* Use recursion, pattern matching and non-modifiable data structures upon implementation in a functional programming language.
* Use functions as first order objects and work with the functions of higher order.
* Explain the basics of functional programming, its structure and operational semantics.
* Evaluate functions with regard to time complexity.
* Use message based multi-threaded programming.
